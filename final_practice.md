# CMPSC 100 Practice Questions for the Final Exam
# Name:


##### Note: These are just some practice questions and the number of questions does not represent the length of the exam.


### Question 1
Here is a complete class named `Tree`:
```
       public class Tree {
           public String name;
           public boolean deciduous;

           public Tree(String newName, boolean status) {
               name = newName;
               deciduous = status;
           }

           public String getName() {
               return name;
           }

           public boolean isDeciduous() {
               return deciduous;
           }
       }
```
Write a `main` method that creates three `Tree` variables
named `oak`, `elm`, and `pine`.  The first two are
deciduous, the last is not. That's all---the method just declares
three variables and  doesn't do anything else.


``` diff 
Sample Answer:

public void main() {
   Tree oak = new Tree ("oak", true);
   Tree elm = new Tree ("elm", true);
   Tree pine = new Tree ("pine", true);
}
```

### Question 2
What is the final value of `count` when each of the following loops is
finished executing?

```
int count = 0;
for (int j = 1; j < 10; j++) {
  count ++;
}
```

``` diff 
Sample Answer:
count = 10
```

```
int count = 0;
for (int j = 0; j <= 10; j++) {
  count ++;
}
```

``` diff 
Sample Answer:
count = 11
```

```
int count = 0;
int value = 1;
while (value <= 5) {
  value += 2;
  count = count + value;
}
```

``` diff 
Sample Answer:
count = 15
```

### Question 3
Write the Java statements needed to find the sum of the first 20 positive
odd integers, that is, the sum 1+3+5+ ... (20th terms in the sum). The
final value should be stored in an `int` variable named `sum`
which you must declare and initialize. Use some kind of loop structure;
don't simply type in all of the odd integers in a great big sum expression!

``` diff 
Sample Answer:

int sum = 0;
int count = 0;
while(count < 20) {
   if(count % 2 != 0) {
      sum += count;
   }
}
```

### Question 4
Write the Java statements needed to create a new `ArrayList` containing
integer values  and to fill it
with the first 1000 consecutive integers, starting with 0.


``` diff 
Sample Answer:

ArrayList<Integer> list = new ArrayList<Integer>();
for(int i = 0; i < 100; i++) {
   list.add(i);
}
```

### Question 5
Given the following Java declaration:
```
        int [ ] nums = new int[25];
```
Write the Java statements needed to fill `nums` with the values of
the first 25 positive multiples of 3, that is, 3, 6, 9, ...


``` diff 
Sample Answer:

int count = 25;
int num = 3;
while(count > 0) {
   if(num % 3 == 0) {
      nums[count] = num;
      count--;
   }
   num++;
}
```

### Question 6
Convert the following for loop into an equivalent do while loop:

```
for(int i = 100; i > 0; i--) {
	System.out.println(i);
}
```

``` diff Sample Answer:

int i = 100;
do {
   System.out.println(i);
   i--;
} while(i > 0);
```

### Question 7
What is the output of the following code segment:

```
    ArrayList<String> list = new ArrayList<String>();
    list.add("Meadville");
    list.add("Cleveland");
    list.add("Wooster");
    list.add("Richmond");

    Iterator<String> iterator = list.iterator();
    while(iterator.hasNext()) {
      switch(iterator.next()) {
    	case "Meadville":
    		System.out.println("Allegheny College");
    		break;
    	case "Wooster":
    		System.out.println("The College of Wooster");
    		break;
    	case "Richmond":
    		System.out.println("Albion College");
    		break;
    	case "default":
    		System.out.println("Not Found");
    		break;
      }
    }
```


``` diff 
Sample Answer:

Allegheny College
The College of Wooster
Albion College
```

### Question 8
Suppose a class contains an instance variable declared as follows:

`private boolean visible;`

Assume the value of `visible` has been assigned elsewhere in the program. Write a method that changes the value of `visible` to its opposite (so if `visible` is true, it will be set to false and vice-versa). Nothing is returned.

``` diff 
Sample Answer:

public void setVisible(boolean value) {
   if(visible) {
      visible = false;
   } else {
      visible = true;
   }
}
```

### Question 9
*True* or *False*. If an array named list has size 10, its final element is denoted by list.get(9).

``` diff 
Sample Answer:
True
```

### Question 10
Examine the following Java statements, then fill in the rest of the code as instructed. You do not need to write a complete program, just the Java statements to fulfill the following tasks.
* (a) Initialize the array list.
* (b) Using the scan variable and a loop, get thirteen names typed at the user's keyboard and save them into the roster array list.
* (c) Print the contents of the roster array list, one name per line.

``` diff
(a) ArrayList<String> list = new ArrayList<String>();

(b) 
for(int count = 0; count < 13; count++) {
    list.add(scan.nextLine());
}

(c)
for(int count = 0; count < list.size(); count++) {
    System.out.println(list.get(count));
}
```
